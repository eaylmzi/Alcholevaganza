Alcholevaganza
This is the graduation project of the android course that I participate.
If I had to summarize my project, if we do not know a drink or a type of cocktail, we can learn about these types of alcohol through my application.
We can do a research by type of drink such as wine or whiskey or we can search by the name of a cocktail.
In addition, we can find the appropriate cocktail by typing what kind of ingredients we want in a cocktail such as syrup, strawberries or gin and we can add these cocktails or drinks to my favorites to remember.

These are some queries that we can save in the room database and try.
