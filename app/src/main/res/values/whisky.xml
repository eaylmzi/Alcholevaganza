        <string name="scotch9">Scotch, like other whiskies, is not something consumed for intoxication. Scotch drinkers savor its potency, rich history and tradition. Like wines, the regions of Scotland produce unique varieties and flavors. To receive the honor of being called Scotch, the drink must be made from malted barley, be aged for no less than three years and made in Scotland.</string>
        <string name="irish10">Irish whiskey has an equally long (if not longer) and turbulent history as Scotch. While varied, a general descriptor would be light, fruity and much less peaty than its Scottish counterpart. Traditionally, Irish whiskey is triple distilled in a copper pot versus the double distillation popular in Scotland. Whiskies in Ireland are divided by classifications.</string>
        <string name="american11">Something that separates a few American whiskey varieties from European styles, is that they are aged in new charred oak barrels and remain under 80 percent alcohol by volume. Under American whiskey, there are six distinct categories with differing taste profiles; however, broadly speaking, American whiskey is sweeter, less smoky, and less peaty than Scotch and Irish whiskey. It is has less of a briny or smoky flavor because it is rarely smoked with peat.</string>
